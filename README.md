# Modified-Deedy-ResumeX
A basic LaTeX resume meant for freshers (functional format: focuses less on Work Experience and more on skills &amp; achievements). Licenses, certifications, etc. should be added as per relevance. Intended for use by students currently pursuing a degree in order to apply for fellowships and internships.
